        <p>Thor is an amazing character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What's not to love about him? He is so strong and the way his character has developed has allowed him to be funny too. Thor used to be a very ignored and underutilized character. It wasn't until Thor: Ragnarok that Thor actually became a beloved character. Thor: Ragnarok introduced a very funny and energetic character shift, but more importantly a powerful one. Thor is a god after all. He is 1500 years old and has so much potential. We didn't get to see that potential until Thor: Ragnarok and then we got a huge dose of his power in Avengers: Infinity War. The transition we have seen have made Thor my personal favorite Avenger, and superhero for that matter. This page is to share my love of that beloved character.  </p>
