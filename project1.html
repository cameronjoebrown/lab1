            AM - 5.5 miles. 40 min with 5 min tempo. My right IT band still isn't 100%, but I felt good enough to do a little pick up in the middle of my run.

            PM - 4.5 miles. 40 min easy. I took it a bit easier today. IT band is still giving me issues.

            AM - 6.5 miles. 50 min easy. I felt a lot better today, but I think the issues I had yesterday are originating from a tight IT band.

            AM - 6.5 miles. 50 min easy. I felt a lot better today, besides my right shin muscles. They were feeling pretty tired the whole run. I'm not sure why. They didn't have any problems when I was rolling out over the weekend. It was nice to get in a much longer run today than I have been doing. I went out around 10, but it was a cloudy day so it wasn't nearly as hot as last week.
