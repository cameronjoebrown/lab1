        <h5>Abusive Relationships</h5>
        <p>One of the coolest parts of Avengers: Infinity War is the deep story between Thanos and Gamora. Not only is it one of the most heartbreaking parts of the whole movie, it provides a very cool connection to reality. Most people see Thanos as a psychopath and a very unrelatable character, but his relationship with Gamora is very much an abusive relationship. Even though Thanos has not been the ideal father for Gamora and is a very evil guy, he still loves Gamora very much. Even Gamora finds this suprising as Thanos has never treated her as such. That is how abusive relationships are. The abuser loves the person they abuse very much. The abuse has nothing to do with how they feel about the person. They just have a very different idea of what a relationship should be like. The one being abused also has a weird love for the abuser as well. The abuser still does nice things and shows love for the person. So even though the one being abused should hate the person and leave them, they really don't and they struggle to leave them. Gamora has a moment where she thinks she has killed Thanos and starts crying because of it. Gamora is no stranger to killing someone, but believing she has killed Thanos is heartbreaking to her. </p>
